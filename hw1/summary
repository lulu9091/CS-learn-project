For the Hw1
1,readLine() will read the content line by line and the carriage will move to the next line automatilly.
So if you want to read two lines, the only thing you need to do is repeat this code twice
2, know how to define the string array. 
String Lines[]= new String[5];
Lines[i]=website.readLine();
or

String Lines[]; define the type string array;
Lines= new String[5];  open  a area for String



For the Hw2
an idea of replace a chariteristier in the middle of the string just combine the one before it and the one after it with code substring.;
